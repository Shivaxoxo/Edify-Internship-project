## Overview
The Cancer Cell Prediction project aims to accurately classify cells as cancerous or non-cancerous using machine learning techniques. This project is built using Python, leveraging popular libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains features extracted from cell images, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more. The target variable is a binary classification indicating whether a cell is cancerous or not.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shivaxoxo/Edify-Internship-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Edify-Internship-Project
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start using the model for prediction:

1. **Preprocess the data:** Ensure the dataset is clean and split into training and testing sets.

2. **Train the model:** Run the script to train the model.
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Make predictions:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input data.csv --output results.csv
    ```

## Model Details
The model used in this project is a [describe your model here, e.g., Random Forest Classifier, Convolutional Neural Network]. The choice of model was based on [brief reasoning for model selection].

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. Detailed performance metrics are available in the `results/` directory.
